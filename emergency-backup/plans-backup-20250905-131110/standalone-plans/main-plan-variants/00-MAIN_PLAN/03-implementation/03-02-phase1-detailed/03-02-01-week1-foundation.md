# Week 1: Project Structure & Database Foundation

**Родительский план**: [../03-02-phase1-detailed.md](../03-02-phase1-detailed.md)

## Overview
Week 1 focuses on establishing the foundational architecture for the DigitalMe platform, including .NET 8 solution structure, PostgreSQL database setup with Entity Framework Core, and core infrastructure patterns.

## Daily Implementation Plan

### [Day 1: Solution Setup & Package References](03-02-01-week1-foundation/03-02-01-01-solution-setup.md)
- Create .NET 8 multi-project solution structure
- Configure NuGet packages for all layers
- Establish build and health check pipelines
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Key Deliverables**: Working solution with Swagger UI and health checks

### [Day 2: Database Context Setup & Migrations](03-02-01-week1-foundation/03-02-01-02-database-context.md)
- Implement Entity Framework Core DbContext
- Configure PostgreSQL with JSONB support
- Create initial database migrations
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Key Deliverables**: Database schema with personality profiles and conversations

### [Day 3: Entity Models & Architectural Decisions](03-02-01-week1-foundation/03-02-01-03-entity-models.md)
- Design PersonalityProfile and Conversation entities
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Implement core domain models
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Key Deliverables**: Complete entity models with JSONB trait storage

### [Day 4: Repository Pattern & DI Configuration](03-02-01-week1-foundation/03-02-01-04-di-configuration.md)
- Implement repository pattern with architecture stubs
- Configure dependency injection container
- Define cross-cutting concerns specifications
- **Duration**: 4 hours
- **Key Deliverables**: Complete infrastructure setup with logging and caching specs

## Week 1 Success Criteria

- ✅ **Compilation**: `dotnet build` (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- ✅ **Database**: Migrations applied, connection verified in health check
- ✅ **API Startup**: Service starts on port 5000, Swagger UI accessible
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: `/health` endpoint returns comprehensive status
- ✅ **Architecture Documentation**: ADRs created for major decisions
- ✅ **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Specifications defined for logging, caching, error handling
- ✅ **Repository Pattern**: Architecture stubs implemented with clear TODO specifications
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: All services registered and resolvable
- ✅ **Structured Logging**: Serilog configured with JSON output and correlation IDs
