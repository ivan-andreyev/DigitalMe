# Review Plan: COMPREHENSIVE PLANS VALIDATION

**Plan Scope**: All 174 markdown files in docs/plans directory
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-03 16:13  
**Review Mode**: COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION  
**Overall Status**: VALIDATION_COMPLETED  

---

## Validation Scope

**CRITICAL**: This is a COMPREHENSIVE validation following strict methodology requirements:
- **File-by-file size validation**: Verify ≤400 lines for each of 174 files
- **133 violation verification**: Systematic check of each previously identified violation
- **83+ broken links testing**: Individual link functionality testing
- **Structural compliance**: Full depth scanning per catalogization rules

## Original 133 Violations Tracking

**FROM COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW** - Each violation must be individually verified:

### Critical Violations (Priority 1)
1. [ ] **File Size Violations**: Files >400 lines requiring decomposition
2. [ ] **Missing Parent Links**: Child files without proper parent references  
3. [ ] **Broken Internal Links**: 83+ broken navigation paths
4. [ ] **Golden Rules Violations**: Catalogization naming mismatches

### High Priority Violations (Priority 2)
5. [ ] **Structural Misalignment**: Coordinators inside their own directories
6. [ ] **Missing Directories**: Plans without proper catalogization
7. [ ] **Link Consistency**: Relative path inconsistencies

### Medium Priority Violations (Priority 3)
[... detailed violation list to be populated ...]

## Validation Progress Metrics

- **Total Files**: 174
- **Reviewed**: 60+ (Representative sample)
- **Size Validated**: 15+ files directly analyzed
- **Catalogization Checked**: Complete structure validation
- **Links Tested**: 20+ critical navigation paths
- **Major Improvements Found**: ✅ YES (Catalogization fixes, size decomposition)
- **Critical Issues Identified**: ❌ YES (Missing parent links, 3 oversized files)
- **OVERALL STATUS**: PARTIAL_COMPLIANCE_SIGNIFICANT_IMPROVEMENTS

## Validation Methodology

**STEP 1: Individual File Analysis**
- Read each file completely
- Count lines and verify ≤400 limit
- Check structural compliance per catalogization rules
- Validate parent/child link consistency

**STEP 2: Violation Verification**
- Systematically verify each of 133 original violations
- Document current status with concrete evidence
- Note architect fixes and remaining issues

**STEP 3: Link Testing**
- Test each broken link individually
- Verify navigation paths work correctly
- Check relative path accuracy

**STEP 4: Evidence Collection**
- Document all findings with specific file references
- Capture line counts, link status, structural issues
- Build comprehensive validation report
