---

## Architecture Quality Assessment

### Clean Architecture Compliance ✅

**Layer Structure Validation**:
```
✅ Presentation Layer → Application Layer (Controllers use Orchestrators)
✅ Application Layer → Domain Layer (Use Cases use Repository interfaces)  
✅ Infrastructure Layer → Application + Domain (Implements abstractions)
✅ Domain Layer → No dependencies (Pure business logic)
```

**Dependency Flow**: CORRECT in all directions

### SOLID Principles Compliance ✅

#### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- FileProcessingUseCase: File operations only
- WebNavigationUseCase: Navigation testing only
- ServiceAvailabilityUseCase: Availability checking only
- HealthCheckUseCase: Health monitoring only
- WorkflowOrchestrator: Composition only

#### ✅ Open/Closed Principle
- New use cases can be added without modifying existing ones
- Extension through composition, not modification

#### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle
- All implementations are fully substitutable
- Interface contracts honored by all implementations

#### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle
- Each use case has focused interface
- No fat interfaces forcing unnecessary dependencies

#### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle
- Use cases depend on abstractions (IFileRepository)
- Infrastructure implements abstractions
- Dependencies point toward abstractions

## Test Infrastructure Assessment

### Current Test Status

**Unit Tests**: 78/78 passing (100% success rate) ✅  
**Integration Tests**: 44/62 passing (71% success rate) ⚠️  
**Overall Test Health**: Significantly improved with remaining integration issues

### Integration Test Analysis

**Passing Categories**:
- ✅ Authentication flow tests (5/5)
- ✅ Chat flow tests (8/8) 
- ✅ Frontend smoke tests (6/6)
- ✅ Tool strategy tests (6/6)
