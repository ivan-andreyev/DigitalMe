4. **HTTPS Configuration Issues** - Security/deployment concern
5. **SOLID Architecture Violations** - Long-term maintainability concern

### Resolution Strategy:
- **STOP all feature development** until architecture is fixed
- **Fix critical violations** before adding any new capabilities
- **Resolve test infrastructure** before making any production claims
- **Only THEN proceed** with actual production deployment

**DO NOT PROCEED** with any new features or enhancements until:
1. **All architectural violations are fixed**
2. **Test pass rate reaches 95%+**
3. **All production readiness gates are achieved**
4. **Independent architecture review confirms 8/10+ score**

### Expected Outcome After Remediation:
- **Genuinely production-ready Ivan-Level Agent**

**Document Status**: CRITICAL - Mandatory remediation required before production
**Next Action**: Begin architecture remediation with god class refactoring
**Completion Target**: 5-7 days intensive remediation work
