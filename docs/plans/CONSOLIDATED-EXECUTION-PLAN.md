## üîÑ RESOLUTION MATRIX

### Conflict Resolution

#### 1. Timeline Conflict: 12 days vs 6 weeks
**Resolution:** Hybrid 6-week approach with 3-week checkpoints
**Rationale:** Balances business urgency with technical completeness

#### 2. Code Quality Approach: Recovery vs Strategy
**Resolution:** Automated tooling first (30 mins) + Test strategy (4 weeks)
**Rationale:** Quick wins followed by systematic improvement

#### 3. Business Priority: Demo vs Ivan-Level
**Resolution:** Demo foundation enables Ivan-Level enhancement
**Rationale:** Sequential execution reduces risk while delivering value

### Duplication Elimination

#### 1. Ivan-Level Tasks: COMPLETION vs STRATEGIC
**Resolution:** IVAN_LEVEL_COMPLETION provides detailed implementation
**Action:** Archive STRATEGIC-NEXT-STEPS after extracting unique items

#### 2. Architecture Plans: HYBRID vs INTEGRATION  
**Resolution:** HYBRID provides comprehensive recovery approach
**Action:** Merge INTEGRATION-FOCUSED unique items into HYBRID execution
